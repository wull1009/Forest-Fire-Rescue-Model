# Forest-Fire-Rescue-Model
This is a course report for a mathematical modeling course. Forest fires are a sudden and devastating natural disaster. The research in this project focuses on how to weigh the cost of damage against the cost of rescue so that the cost of fighting forest fires is as small as possible.
